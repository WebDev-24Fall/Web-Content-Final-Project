# Data Visualization Project

## Assignment

For this project youâ€™ll work on creating graphs and visualizations using the D3 library, while using your knowledge of HTML/CSS to improve the design and appearance of your creation.

An example project: Take data from a REST API for FIFA results and feed it into D3 to display several different graphs (bar, circle, map) to help make sense of the data visually.

This project will be completed in a group of 2-3 members.
